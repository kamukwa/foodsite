#### A simple and clean food delivery website, April 2025  
#### By **Kamukwa**

## Description  
Adnanâ€™s Kitchen is a food delivery website where people can check out delicious meals and order directly from the site. Itâ€™s designed to be super easy to use and looks clean and modern. The main goal is to let users quickly browse meals and place orders without any confusion.

One cool feature on the site is that users can **mark their favorite meals**, so they can easily come back and find the dishes they love most. It makes the experience more personal and user-friendly.

Even though it's built with just HTML and CSS, it feels like a real restaurant site and looks super professional. Itâ€™s already live online and ready to explore!

## Setup/Installation Requirements  
No downloads or installations are needed â€” just visit:

ðŸ‘‰ [https://kamukwa.github.io/foodsite/](https://kamukwa.github.io/foodsite/)

But if you want to run it on your own computer:

1. Download or clone the repo  
2. Open the folder on your computer  
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser  
4. Done! No server or extra setup needed

## Known Bugs  
- No actual order processing (like payments or deliveries â€” itâ€™s just the front-end for now)  
- The favorite meals feature is more visual â€” it doesnâ€™t save between visits yet  
- No user accounts or logins yet

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

Even with just HTML and CSS, I added smooth layouts, buttons, and a favorite meals feature to make it interactive and fun to use.
